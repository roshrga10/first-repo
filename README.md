My favorite superpower is teleportation probably because being able to go from one place to another whenever you want seems pretty interesting. If I ever want to escape a situation I'm uncomfortable with or let's say I'm in danger, it's pretty convenient for me to just teleport elsewhere. I love to travel as well so imagine being able to go anywhere I want without the airplane bills or airsickness since I suffer from that too. Also, it happens so quickly and smoothly makes it seem amazing and fun.
